# Jane Maps Examples

This directory contains example implementations of the jane-maps framework.  

## How to use
  * This example depends on the built `jane-maps` existing in `../dist`.  Do `npm run build` on the root `jane-maps` directory and make sure `/dist` is created.

  * Install dependencies: `npm install`
  * Transpile JSX and serve with webpack-dev-server: `npm start`
  * Load `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
